# IAR RISC-V GD32V EVAL - ADC example

For the __ADC__ example, attach an USB cable on __J7__ for the __USART__ to operate.
Configure the Serial Port in the Virtual Terminal with the following settings:

| __Setting__    |  __Selection__  |
| :------------- | :-------------- |
| Baud rate      | 115200          |
| Data           | 8               |
| Bit Parity     | None            |
| Stop bit       | 1               |
| Flow Control   | None            |

As the potentiometer R1 changes, its value is shown through the serial port on regular intervals.
