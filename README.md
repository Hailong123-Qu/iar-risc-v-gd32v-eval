# Getting started with IAR RISC-V GD32V Evaluation board

This guide briefly describes how to get started using the IAR [Embedded Workbench for RISC-V](https://iar.com/riscv) with the __I-jet Lite__ debug interface. The project examples in this repository are designed to be run on the IAR RISC-V GD32 Eval board.


For documentation and schematics, follow this [link](docs).


Make sure that the following jumpers are correctly configured on the evaluation board:

| __Jumper__     | __Description__ |   __Position__  |
| :------------- | :-------------- |  -------------- |
| J6             | Power USB/Debug |  1-2            |
| J5             | Green LED       |  2-3            |
| J8             | Red LED         |  2-3            |
| J9             | Blue LED        |  3-4            |
